# `07` String Concatenation

One of JavaScript's strengths is generating HTML code. 
Concatenation comes in handy because you can create and add to existing HTML strings. To concatenate strings, we use the **+** (plus) operator. 

For example:

```js
var one = 'a';
var two = 'b';
console.log(one+two); //this will print 'ab' on the console.
```

## :pencil: Instructions
* Set the values for **myVar1** and **myVar2** so the code prints **'Hello World'** to the console.
