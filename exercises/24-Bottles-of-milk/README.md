# `24` Bottles of Milk 

Have you heard the song about 99 bottles of milk? 

It is a great song - not boring at all... :laughing:

## :pencil: Instructions:
* Write an algorithm to print the exact same lyrics.

### :bulb: HINT:
* Use loops to complete this task
* The lyrics change slightly when there is one bottle left (singular instead of plural).
* When there are no more bottles, the last verse changes to `go to the store and by some more`.


### :scroll: Note:
The console should print the following:

`99 bottles of milk on the wall, 99 bottles of milk.` 
`Take one down and pass it around, 98 bottles of milk on the wall.`

`98 bottles of milk on the wall, 98 bottles of milk.`
`Take one down and pass it around, 97 bottles of milk on the wall.`

...
...

`1 bottle of milk on the wall, 1 bottle of milk.`
`Take one down and pass it around, no more bottles of milk on the wall.`

`No more bottles of milk on the wall, no more bottles of milk.` 
`Go to the store and buy some more, 99 bottles of milk on the wall.`
