# `21` Looping with FizzBuzz

This is a typical beginner test that is required to complete interviews in Google, Facebook and all other big tech unicorns.

## :pencil: Instructions:
* Write the code needed to print to the console all the numbers from `1` to `100`. 
* For multiples of 3, instead of the number, print `Fizz`.
* For multiples of 5, print `Buzz`. 
* For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print `FizzBuzz`.

Example output:
