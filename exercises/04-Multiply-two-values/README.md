# `04` Multiply Two Values

Programming languages, such as Javascript, allow for basic math operations (multiplication, division, etc.) to be performed on expressions.

To multiply two values in Javascript, use the asterisk operator like this:

```js
var resultingValue = 2 * 3;
```

In this instance, we stored the product of `2 * 3` into a variable called `resultingValue`.

## :pencil: Instructions

* Store the product of 2345 times 7323 in a variable called **variablesAreCool**.
* Print the result to the console.
