# `22` Russian Roulette 

Have you ever played Russian Roulette? It's super fun! 

If you make it (wuuuahahahaha).

Revolvers can have 6 chambers for bullets. A single bullet is inserted into one of the chambers. The revolver chambers are spun to make the game random. Nobody knows the position of the bullet.

FIRE!!!....... Are you dead?

## :pencil: Instructions:
The game is almost working.
* The **fireGun()** function needs to be completed to make the game work. It should compare the bullet position against the chamber position.

### :bulb: HINT:
- If the bullet position matches the chamber position, the function `fireGun()` should return `You're dead!`
- If the bullet position doesn't match the chamber position, the function `fireGun()` should return `Keep playing!`
