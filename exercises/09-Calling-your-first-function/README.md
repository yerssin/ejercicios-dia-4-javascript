# `09` Calling Your First Function

Functions are an amazing tool for programmers!  Think of functions like black boxes  - you input something, you get something out. A function's strengths include, but are not limited to:
* Encapsulation of code from the rest of the program (hiding code). This is an important concept that you will learn more about as you grow as a developer.
* Reuse of code in different programs.  You can treat functions as tools in a toolbox.  This can make coding more efficient and clean.

### :exclamation: IMPORTANT: 

*There are exercises dedicated to functions. We encourage you to go and finish those after completing this exercise. Once you feel more comfortable with [functions](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/javascript-functions-exercises-tutorial), return here.*

## :pencil: Instructions

The already defined function **isOdd()** returns `true` if an odd number is passed as an argument, and `false` if the argument is an even number.
* Call the function `isOdd()` and pass the number 45345 as its argument.
* Print the output of the function to the console.
