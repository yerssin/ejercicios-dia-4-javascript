# `15` Random Numbers

The **Math.random()** function will return a random decimal number between 0 and 1, run the exercise as it is several times to test it.

## :pencil: Instructions:
* Please update the function code to make it return an integer (no decimals) number between 1 and 10.

### ğŸ’¡ Hint:
* Math.random only returns decimal numbers from 0 to 1, and we need Integer numbers from 1 to 10. 
* Multiply the **Math.random()** by 10 to move the decimal 2 slots to the right.
* Use the **Math.floor()** function to remove the rest of the decimals and have only integers.
