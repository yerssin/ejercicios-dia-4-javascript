# `18` Creating a "for" Loop

As we just learned, loops are useful to repeat a task quickly and efficiently using little code.  As you continue on your journey as a developer, the `for` loop will become an indispensible tool.

Here again is the template of a `for` loop:

```js
for (initialExpression; conditional; incrementalExpression) {
    ...statements;
}
```
... and here is an example `for` statement:

```js
// a "for" loop
for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    console.log("Hello!")
}
```

## :pencil: Instructions:
Your Web Development instructor wants to make sure you understand that asking questions is important in your growth as a programmer. He/She wants you to type `I will write questions if I'm stuck` 300 times to the console!  Fortunately, you know a quick way to accomplish this - using a `for` loop!

* Create a function called **standardsMaker()** that prints the phrase `I will write questions if I'm stuck` 300 times.
