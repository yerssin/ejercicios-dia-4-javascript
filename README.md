<h2>One click installation:</h2>

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io#https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/javascript-beginner-exercises-tutorial.git)


## Local Installation

1. Install learnpack, the package manager for learning tutorials and the html compiler plugin for learnpack, make sure you also have node.js 12+:

```
$ npm i learnpack -g
$ learnpack plugins:install learnpack-node
```

2. Download this particular exercise using learnpack and `cd` into the folder:

```
$ learnpack download javascript-beginner-exercises-tutorial
$ cd javascript-beginner-exercises-tutorial
```

Note: Once you finish downloading, you will find a "exercises" folder that contains all the exercises within.

3. Start the tutorial/exercises by running the following command at the same level were your bc.json file is:

```sh
$ $ pip3 install pytest==4.4.2 pytest-testdox mock
$ learnpack start
```

Note: The exercises have automatic grading but its very rigid and string, my recomendation is to ignore the tests and use them only as a recomendation or you can get frustrated.

## How are the exercises organized?

Each exercise is a small react application containing the following files:
|    |    |
|:---|:---|
| **app.js** | Represents the entry python file that will be executed by the computer |
| **README.md** | Contains exercise instructions |
| **test.js** | Contains the testing script for the exercise (you don't have to open this file) |
